# QR-Eye
Source for a simple Chrome extension which displays a QR-based URL of the page currently displayed by the browser. Makes it easy to load the same URL on a mobile device. I found it handy while developing mobile-friendly sites. Follow Google's instructions to package up these files into an extension.
